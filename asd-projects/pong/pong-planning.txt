User story/Gameplay
 - It'll be like the classic Pong game, where the board will feature two paddles and a ball that bounces around the screen. 
    A point system will be implemented where a point will be given to the opposing player if the ball collides with the wall
    past one of the paddles. If there's enough time, I'd like to make a sort of four players version where the 3rd and 4th 
    paddles are stationed at the top and bottom of the screen. In that case, the other 3 players will gain a point when the
    ball collides with one player's 'goal'
 - The game will have an end. The default will most likely be first to 10 points, but I wanna make some settings where the 
    player can change things like win condition, paddle color, and maybe even make a timer. 
 - Most of the if conditions will be for collision detection with the ball. For example, 'if the right side of the ball touches 
    the right edge of the screen, add points to opposing player(s) and reset ball location.' Another will be added for the left
    side of the ball. I will also have to add some conditions for the ball when colliding with the paddle. Like this - 'if the
    ball's x coordinates align with one of the paddle's x values, ball will bounce in the opposite direction" Those example are
    really all I can think to need off the top of my head but I'm sure i'll need more for other things

Visual Game Componenets
 - I think as long as I don't add anymore to the background of the page the only visual components will be the ball, the board,
    and the paddles
    - the only static component will be the board
    - the animated components will be the ball and paddles
 - I'll need constantly updated positions for each of the animated components, which will include the x and y positions for the
  paddles,that and both speedX and speedY for the ball. I'll need the board's width and height for the point system as well. The 
  last variables will be point trackers for each player.

Events/logic
 - I'll need keyboard events for paddle movement, like the arrow keys and wasd, and maybe some shortcut keys for the settings
    menu. For movement, the event will record keys pressed and compare them with the key variables to determine what movement
    the player is trying to input and the event will be triggered for that key. The same thing will happen with the shortcut keys
 - If I do make a timer, it'll probably be a game mode rather than a feature. For that I'll have events for when the timer reaches
    a certain amount of time left. For example, when the timer reaches 30 seconds, I can have a message pop up above the board that 
    says "time's almost up!"
 - I don't think I'll have any clicking events because it don't plan on having any buttons. If i do, there'll be a reset button to
 reset the game, and a little settings gear in the bottom right corner for the settings screen. For that I'll have event for registering 
 when the button is clicked.
